# xps13archlinuxdotfiles

Curated dotfiles for this Arch Linux XPS 13.

Included
- Top-level shell/editor/git configs (e.g., .zshrc, .bashrc, .gitconfig)
- Selected `.config` subdirectories for common tools (nvim, zsh, tmux, alacritty, starship, etc.)

Excluded by design (sensitive/volatile)
- .ssh/, .gnupg/, .pki/, .local/, .cache/
- Browser profiles (.config/chromium, .config/google-chrome, .mozilla, etc.)
- Secrets, credentials, and key material if detected

If you want additional apps/configs included, letâ€™s add them intentionally.

## Packages
- `packages/pacman-explicit-native.txt`: explicitly installed native packages
- `packages/pacman-explicit-foreign.txt`: explicitly installed foreign (AUR/manual) packages
- `packages/pacman-all-installed.txt`: all installed packages (reference)

## Desktop Files
- User-local `.desktop` files copied from `~/.local/share/applications`.
- System `.desktop` files are not copied; see `manifests/system-desktop-files.txt` for a list.

Note: `.local/` is generally excluded, but `~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop` is included intentionally for user overrides.
